<h1>"Shoot me instead of him." Kneeling Myanmar nun.</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>
  According to the Guardian on the 9th (local time), Sister An Rose Nuthaung (nun Rose), a member of St. Francis Saberio's convent<br>
   in Michini City, Myanmar, knelt in front of heavily armed military police and begged them not to take their children's lives.
  "I knelt<br> down and begged her not to shoot or torture the children, but rather kill me," Rose told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>Myanmar's military has been cracking down on civilians, including live ammunition and tear gas, after a February 1 coup.
  Citizens<br> took to the streets with helmets and homemade shields in Michini, northern Myanmar. Myanmar's military and police
   began to<br> flock around the protesters to suppress them.<br>
   <br>
  Rose and two other nuns begged to go to the police and go somewhere else. Some military and police officers were seen listening<br>
   to the nun when Sister Rose knelt down, kneeling down and listened to the nun.
   <br>
   <br>
   But while Rose was on her knees, the military and police began shooting at the protesters behind her. Eventually, a man was 
  shot<br> and killed in front of Sister Rose.
  Sister Rose told the newspaper, "The children ran to the front in embarrassment. "I had no choice<br> but to pray to God to 
  save them without doing anything."
