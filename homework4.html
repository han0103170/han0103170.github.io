<p>The 370-meter-diameter asteroid Apophis approached nearly<br> 16.8 million kilometers 
from Earth at 10:15 a.m. on the 6th of<br> this month in Korean time and passed near 
the Earth at 4.58<br> kilometers per second. It approached 43 times the distance<br> between 
the Earth and the moon, and passed by.</p>

<p>The Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute succeeded<br> in observing and releasing
the video on the 10th of this<br> month through tracking and observation using 
the 'OWL-Net'<br> from February.</p>


<p>Asteroid Apophis is a celestial body that has been constantly<br> threatened 
by Earth's collision since it was first discovered in<br> 2004. It is expected 
to pass at 6:46 on April 14, 2029 at a<br> distance of approximately 37,000 km,
very close to Earth.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">Video capture an asteroid Apophis.</p>

<p>The observational video of Apophis, released by the Korea Astronomy and
Space Science Institute, was taken at OWL-Net No. 4 at<br> the Lemon Mountain 
Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>The Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute is conducting preliminary
research on asteroid exploration missions, especially with<br> the aim of directly 
exploring Apophis in 2029. The fact that an asteroid approaches the Earth means 
that only a small amount of fuel<br> provides good conditions for the probe to reach
the asteroid.</p>
