    <h2>Have European countries made a mistake in halting AstraZeneca shots? 
        Here's what health experts say</h2>
    <p>London (CNN)Within the space of a few days, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19
      vaccine has ground to a standstill in virtually all of western Europe.</p>
    
      <p>France, Spain, Germany, Italy and more than a dozen other countries have paused rollout of the shot, 
      calling it a precautionary measure following concerns that it could be linked to blood clots; decisions that go against the advice of global health agencies.</p>
      
      <p></p>A few countries have stood by the vaccine -- including the United Kingdom, where more than 11 
      million doses have already been administered, and where real-world data has shown vaccines are 
      reducing infections and hospitalizations.</p>

    <h2>UK labels Russia top security threat, issues warning on China, 
      and promises to build more nuclear warheads</h2>
    <p>(CNN)Russia is Britain's top security challenge, the UK will build more nuclear 
      weapons and London will expand its presence in the high-tech realms of space and 
      cyberspace, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Tuesday in a sweeping review 
      of British military and foreign policy.</p>
      
    <p>To accomplish its goals, the British government wants to increase defense spending
       by £24 billion ($33.3 billion) over the next four years, a large increase on the 
       £42.2 billion it spent in 2019-2020.</p>
      
      <p> The government also pledged tens of billions of pounds in investment in other areas,
       including £15 billion for research and development for science and technology, 
       more than £17 billion to fight climate change and promote biodiversity, 
       and £13 billion in the fight against the coronavirus.</p>
